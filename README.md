# TargEtsy

## Welcome to TargEtsy

TargEtsy is a tool for targeted marketing on Etsy.
It uses a photograph of a user to predict the kinds of things he/she would be interested in on Etsy and present these things to him/her ordered by increasing radius.

This idea originated as a project at HackNY of Fall 2015. It was built using the ClarifAI API for image recognition and analysis, a database exposed by MongoDB for the hackathon, and the Etsy API.
